# Which AI to use 

For most people you should pick one of three systems: [Claude](https://claude.ai) from Anthropic, Google's [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), and OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). With all of the options, you get access to both advanced and fast models, a voice mode, the ability to see images and documents, the ability to execute code, good mobile apps, the ability to create images and video (Claude lacks here, however), and the ability to do Deep Research. Some of these features are free, but you are generally going to need to pay $20/month to get access to the full set of features you need. I will try to give you some reasons to pick one model or another as we go along, but you can't go wrong with any of them.

What about everyone else? I am not going to cover specialized AI tools (some people love Perplexity for search, Manus is a great agent, etc.) but there are a few other options for general purpose AI systems: [Grok](https://x.ai) by Elon Musk's xAI is good if you are a big X user, though the company has not been very transparent about how its AI operates. Microsoft's [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) offers many of the features of ChatGPT and is accessible to users through Windows, but it can be hard to control what models you are using and when. [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com) r1, a Chinese model, is very capable and free to use, but is missing a few features from the other companies and it is not clear that they will keep up in the long term. So, for most people, just stick with Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT.

### Picking a Platform

Most people should start with one of the big three: ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. They're the most reliable, well-supported, and feature-complete options available.

**Choose based on your primary use case:**

**ChatGPT** if you want:
- The most popular platform with extensive community support
- Advanced Voice Mode for natural conversations
- Strong coding and technical problem-solving
- Regular access to the latest AI capabilities

**Claude** if you focus on:
- Professional writing and document analysis
- Complex reasoning and following detailed instructions
- Working with large amounts of text
- Projects that require consistency and safety

**Gemini** if you need:
- Integration with Google Workspace and services
- Current information and research capabilities
- Productivity workflows that connect to your existing Google tools
- Cost-effective access to powerful models

**For most beginners:** Start with whichever platform feels most natural to you, or try all three with the same task to see which gives you better results. You can always switch or use multiple platforms.

**Consider the specialized options** (Copilot, Grok, Meta AI, DeepSeek) if you have specific needs like Microsoft integration, real-time social media data, or budget constraints.

The key is picking one platform and getting comfortable with it before branching out. Each has a learning curve, and you'll get better results by mastering one than by jumping between several.

### Picking A Model

Use the right model for the task. Each platform offers multiple modelsâ€”like choosing between a quick intern, an experienced consultant, or a world-class expert. They all solve problems, but you'd assign them completely different projects.

**Start with the free models and experiment from there.** Most platforms offer three levels: a speedy model for everyday tasks, a robust model for complex projects, and occasionally a premium reasoning model for the most challenging work.
