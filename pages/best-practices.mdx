# Best Practices Overview

Here's a focused list of AI best practices for beginners, especially relevant when using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini for personal or professional tasks:

### Understanding the Tool

**Don't treat it like Google.**  
Instead of keywords, give clear instructions. Think: "Write a polite follow-up email to a client who missed a meeting," not "client email follow-up."

**AI is a starting point, not a final product.**  
Review, revise, and verify anything it creates—especially if facts or tone matter.

**Know its limitations.**  
It doesn't "know" facts—it predicts words. It can sound confident while being wrong.

### Working Effectively

**Be specific about what you want.**  
Clear, structured inputs yield better outputs. Add context about who you are, what you need, and who it's for.

**Iterate through conversation.**  
You don't need perfect prompts. Ask follow-up questions, refine your input, and go step-by-step.

**Try multiple tools.**  
Compare ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini on the same task. Each has strengths.

### Staying Safe and Smart

**Fact-check important claims.**  
Especially in legal, financial, health, or technical contexts.

**Avoid pasting sensitive or private data.**  
Unless you're using enterprise tools with privacy guarantees.

**Start with low-stakes tasks.**  
Practice on things like rewriting emails or organizing lists before applying it to sensitive work.

**Check tone and appropriateness.**  
The model may not always align tone with your audience.
